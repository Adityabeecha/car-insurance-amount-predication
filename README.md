This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to streamline and enhance the insurance claim assessment process. By accurately predicting insurance amounts based on car damage severity and vehicle make, the project demonstrates significant potential in automating and optimizing a critical aspect of the insurance industry.
This project addresses the challenges of assessing car insurance claims efficiently and accurately. By focusing on damage level classification and brand recognition from car images, our models achieve impressive accuracy levels:

Damage Level Classification: 89% accuracy

Brand Recognition: 87% accuracy

These results showcase the effectiveness of CNN-based models in analyzing car damage and identifying vehicle makes, paving the way for more efficient and accurate insurance claim processes.

Key Features:


Damage Level Classification: Predicts the extent of damage to a car from images.

Brand Recognition: Identifies the make of a vehicle based on visual data.

Automation: Streamlines the insurance claim process by reducing manual effort and improving processing times.

Enhanced Customer Service: Speeds up claim assessments, ensuring timely resolutions and increased customer satisfaction.
